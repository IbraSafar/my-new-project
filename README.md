# Educate children in Somalia 

This is my final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is about developing schools for the children in South and Central Somalia using AI. It is a project that will raise awareness within the community. 


## Background

First of all, my idea solves some problems that most students are going through every single day because of the need they have for education and enhancing the quality of their schools. I have been motivated by the AI course that I did with the University of Helsinki and personally, I have always wanted to develop an AI proejct for the problems that most schools face on a daily basis. 
The main reason why this topic is interesting is that it is my very first AI project and I am looking forward to it. I really want to test my AI knowledge and apply the course within the community. 


Here is a list of the problems that students go through:
* build safe schools. 
* get enough PCs for the students. 



## The way it is going to be used 


I am going to build three new schools for the students and make sure that the environment is a very safe environment for the children. We will do a risk assessment. We will apply an AI method when I am trying to solve the problem. The users of my project will be managers of local NGOs as well as principals of local schools. 


Mostly, the solution will be needed in the evening class for me to raise the points and help them understand that my solutions will help them in the long run but however, what they need to take into account is that there maybe errors or delays during the implementation process. 
Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?



```
def main():
   Schools = ['Mogadishu', 'Baidoa', 'Diinsoor']
   students = [3200, 320, 150,]  
   pcs = [15, 10, 8]

   totSch = sum(sch)
   totStu = sum(students)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%






## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
